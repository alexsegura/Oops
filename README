Oops - Object Oriented PrestaShop

Oops is a tool for PrestaShop. 
It is designed to help develop robust modules faster.  

Features : 

- Fully object oriented
- MVC layer built on Zend Framework
- ORM layer built on Propel ORM
- Module namespace, easy autoload
- PHP and/or Smarty templates

INSTALLATION 

1. Installing Dependencies

Oops needs Zend and Propel to run. 

Download the latest 1.x version of Zend Framework : 
- http://www.zend.com/community/downloads

Download the 1.6.x (or above) version of Propel :
- http://www.propelorm.org/download.html

There are several ways to install both libraries. 
To work, Oops needs them to be in the include_path. 
You can either install them by yourself, or let Oops do the job for you. 

Just make sure Propel and Zend are loadable from the tool/ folder of Prestashop : 

tools/
  +-- propel/
     +-- Propel.php
     +-- ...
  +-- Zend/
     +-- Loader
        +-- Autoloader.php
        +-- ...
  

2. Installing Oops

To install Oops, copy the library/Oops/ folder to the /tools folder of PrestaShop. 
You should end up with : 

tools/
  +-- Oops/
  +-- propel/
  +-- Zend/
  
Then, copy the file override/classes/Configuration.php to the override/classes folder of PrestaShop.
This override is important to allow Oops to register its own autoload function.
